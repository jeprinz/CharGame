- Add XConst to XReactor, which is same as XVar but without set method

For example, I could make a checkbox input
makeCheckBox : [HtmlElement, XConst<boolean>]
internally, the function uses an XVar which the XConst depends on. However,
this should not be accessible from outside

The user interface should be able to be defined in a completely separate place from
